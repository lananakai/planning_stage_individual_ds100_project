Since we are using K-NN, we should also standardize the data during our preparation. In our prediction, we will need to assume that the player, on an average day, consistently logs on at this time. To evaluate our predictions, we should split the data into training and testing, using a proportion of 75% for training and 25% for testing, for a good balance between model and evaluation accuracy. For the best results, we should split the training data into training and validation sets 5 times to use 5-fold-cross-validation and obtain the best value for K by finding what value of K reduces RMSPE.\n",
