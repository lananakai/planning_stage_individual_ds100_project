    "To evaluate our predictions, we should split the data into training and testing, using prop =75% for training and 25% for testing, for a balance between model and evaluation accuracy. We should also split the training data into training and validation sets 5 times to use 5-fold-cross-validation to obtain the best value for K by finding what value of K reduces RMSPE."
